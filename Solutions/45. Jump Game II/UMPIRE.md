1. List out any clarifying questions:


2. List out 1-3 data structures/algorithms that could be useful:
- Greedy

3. Break down the problem into subproblems, provide psuedocode for these subproblems:
- Since we want the minimum amount of jumps, the logic should be that I always want to land on the spots that will take me to the furthest spot
- This spot should be where I land as it is the spot that will take me the farthest, so I would be making the least amount of jumps

4. Assess the space/time complexity:
- Space: O(1) 
- Time: O(n)

5. Optional - Give any ways you would improve your solution:
