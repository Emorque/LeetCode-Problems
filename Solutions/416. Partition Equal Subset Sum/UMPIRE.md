1. List out any clarifying questions:


2. List out 1-3 data structures/algorithms that could be useful:


3. Break down the problem into subproblems, provide psuedocode for these subproblems:
- My first idea is an n^2 approach, where for every point on the list, I check the other points and only pair up the points that have the smallest mahattan distance
- Create an adj list
- Keep adding distances to the minHeap and 

4. Assess the space/time complexity:
- Space: 
- Time: up to n^2 nodes are going to be added to minHeap

5. Optional - Give any ways you would improve your solution:
