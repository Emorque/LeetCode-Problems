1. List out any clarifying questions:


2. List out 1-3 data structures/algorithms that could be useful:


3. Break down the problem into subproblems, provide psuedocode for these subproblems:
- I can adapt my longest palidrome substring solution. 
- instead of comparing substrings, I'll just always increment the count
- I will need to check that for the starting points of (left, right = i,i + 1) what left and right are equal to each other

4. Assess the space/time complexity:
- Space: O(1) since constant space is used
- Time: O(2n) as every character gets explored in a two pass fashion

5. Optional - Give any ways you would improve your solution:
