1. List out any clarifying questions:


2. List out 1-3 data structures/algorithms that could be useful:


3. Break down the problem into subproblems, provide psuedocode for these subproblems:
- I think I would have to know not only how to get up to amount, but also how to get to every total from 0 to amount. And then for each number, have that minimum number of coins ready

4. Assess the space/time complexity:
- Space: O(n) for I need "amount" number of elements in my list
- Time: O(n^c) as I need to execute my for loop n times with each time, me iterating through my coins list

5. Optional - Give any ways you would improve your solution:
